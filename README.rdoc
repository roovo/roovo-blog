= My blog

built using the wonderful Webby: http://github.com/TwP/webby/

many files lifted from Aaron Qian's blog: http://github.com/aq1018/aaron-blog

using the fluid 960 grid system for layout: http://github.com/bauhouse/fluid960gs

----------------
Have to add new blog posts manually as I can't seem to do this with the webby stuuuf

bundle exec webby build               # to build the site
bundle exec webby deploy:custom_ssh   # to deploy
