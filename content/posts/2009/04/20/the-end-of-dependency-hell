Saw an interesting "commit message":http://github.com/wycats/merb/commit/a5ee3a0d9e9e19480a32c35c4267480e816d6592 in the merb repo on github today.

The part that caught my attention was:

<blockquote><p>Adds support for Merb::Config[:ignore_system_gems], which if set to true will *not* fallback to system gems. This enables you to be sure your merb app has all required gems bundled, and not accidently using system gems.</p></blockquote>

This sounds like it has the potential to keep all those nasty already loaded errors at bay.  Can't wait to see if it's true.
